# Cyphology

A library to create ontologies for Neo4J in a human readable way.  
Cyphology is able to read and insert ontologies written in "cyphol".  

```
# Example data  
GraphDb neo4j  

Language cypher {"created_in":2011, "written_by":"AndrÃ©s Taylor"}	
	used_for > neo4j
  
Language cyphol {"created_in":2019, "written_by": "Philipp Sodmann"}
	used_for > neo4j
	inspired_by {"thank":"you"} > cypher
	
Label unique_id {"properties":"as json"}
	relationship_type {"can have properties too": "not yet implemented"} > unique_id
	
# can import data:
import tests/sample_data/sample.cyphol
```

Cyphologie is also capable to validate the Data before inserting it into Neo4J.  
It is in early development for my private project.
